# SebatNet Lite

> Fast cigarette smoking detection with ONNX, [Linzaer's face detection model](https://github.com/Linzaer/Ultra-Light-Fast-Generic-Face-Detector-1MB), and [gitfarhan's smoking detection model](https://github.com/gitfarhan/smoking_detector_demo).

## How to use

1. `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` to install required modules.
2. You can import sebatnet to your script or use `python3 video_example.py`.

## Limitation

This script uses a small model that prioritizes inference speed over accuracy.
